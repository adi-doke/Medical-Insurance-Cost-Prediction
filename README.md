# 🩺 Medical Insurance Cost Prediction
A Machine Learning project that predicts a person’s medical insurance charges based on demographic and health-related features. The project covers end-to-end ML development including data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## 🚀 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a regression model that can accurately estimate medical insurance costs using the insurance.csv dataset.
The model learns patterns from key input features such as:
* Age
* Gender
* BMI
* Children
* Smoker status
* Region
This is a complete machine learning pipeline — from raw dataset to final ready-to-use predictive model.
