# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction
This project predicts an individualâ€™s medical insurance charges based on demographic and health-related factors such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and region. Using a dataset of real-world insurance records, the project applies machine learning techniques to uncover patterns between these factors and insurance costs.
